# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT  

# **Project : Bank customer churn model**

This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them, thereby improving customer satisfaction and profitability.  

## Objectives: 
a) Predict Customer Churn: Develop a model to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.  
b) Identify Key Factors: Determine the key factors that influence customer churn.  
c) Improve Retention Strategies: Provide actionable insights to help the bank improve its customer retention strategies.  

## Data Description: 
The dataset used for this project contains information about bank customers, including:  
-__CustomerID__- Unique identifier for each customer.  
-__Surname__- Customer’s surname.  
-__CreditScore__- Credit score of the customer.  
-__Geography__- Country of the customer.  
-__Gender__- Gender of the customer.  
-__Age__- Age of the customer.  
-__Tenure__- Number of years the customer has been with the bank.  
-__Balance__- Account balance of the customer.  
-__NumOfProducts__- Number of products the customer has with the bank.  
-__HasCrCard__- Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
-__IsActiveMember__- Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
-__EstimatedSalary__- Estimated salary of the customer.  
-__Churn__- Whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  

# Methodology
### 1- **Data Preprocessing**
  * Handle missing values.  
  * Encode categorical variables.  
  * Scale numerical features.
### 2- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  * Visualize data distributions.
  * Identify correlations between features and churn.
### 3- **Model Development**
* Split the data into training and testing sets.  
* Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### 4- **Model Evaluation**
* Compare model performance.
* Select the best-performing model.
### 5- **Feature Importance**  
* Identify the most important features influencing churn.
### 6- **Deployment**  
* Deploy the model using a web application (e.g., Flask, Streamlit) for real-time predictions.

# Conclusion
The Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps the bank take proactive measures to retain customers. By understanding the key factors that drive churn, the bank can develop targeted strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.  

# Future Work
Model Improvement: Explore advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.   
Feature Engineering: Create new features based on domain knowledge to enhance the model’s predictive power.  
Real-Time Predictions: Integrate the model into the bank’s CRM system for real-time churn predictions.
